Control your PC's RGB lighting with your Fitbit's heart rate monitor!

Both color and pulse rate will be impacted. For example, if your heart rate is high, the light will pulse quickly and be a bright red color.

### Implementation details
- We will use the OpenRGB SDK to provide support for the largest number of RGB devices on both Windows and Linux.
- We will start out with the Fitbit API, as it is one of the most widely used heart rate monitors currently.
- We may add support for other devices, such as Garmin or Apple watch, later on.

### How to contribute
